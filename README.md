# Simple Nautilus\*

An interactive application in Python that allows the user to send commands to a file management application and receive outputs. The application largely mocks common Unix commands such as `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, and so on.

On the high level, the application is capable of:

1. interpret commands received on standard input.
2. produce messages on standard output.
3. maintain some data structure that keeps track of a ***virtual*** name space.
4. create, delete and move ***virtual*** files and folders during program run time.
5. support user and permission management in addition to file management.

In Linux system, you can interact with the Terminal prompt to navigate in the file system using `cd`, to perform actions to create, move, delete and copy files using `touch` `mv` `rm` `cp`, to alter the ownership and permission of files by `chown` `chmod` and to add or remove users by `adduser` `deluser`.

Note that the system is incapable of storing content but purely the file system structure. This is an intensional design and therefore the size of a file is not defined and is omitted in the system. Similarly, the concept of time and `group` is omitted intentional. Please see the whole specification for more details.

## Formatting Syntax

It is very common that command strings are written in a simple template language: characters are usually interpreted literally into themselves, but format specifiers, which are enclosed by parentheses, indicate the location and method to translate a piece of placeholder to characters.

In Simple Nautilus, the following formatting is used:

- Formatted arguments enclosed in sharp brackets `<` and `>` can be replaced by any single syntactically valid string.
- Formatted arguments enclosed in square brackets `[` and `]` can be replaced by zero or one syntactically valid string.
- Parameters that are not further specified can be any string. In order to be considered as a single syntactically valid parameter, a string that contains whitespace has to be enclosed by double quotation marks.
- Syntactically valid does not suggest semantically valid. E.g. `"/a/b/c/d"` is a syntactically valid string, but it might be semantically invalid given an environment where `"/a/b/c/d"` does not exist and the user tries to `ls /a/b/c/d`.

### Example

A formatted string

``` default
<a>@<b>:<c>,[d]
```

can be extended by

``` default
Never@" Gonna ":"Give You","up"
```

`<a>`, `<b>`, `<c>` and `[d]` are extended to `Never`, `" Gonna "`, `"Give You"` and `"up"`.

or

``` default
Among@Us:yo,
```

`<a>`, `<b>` and `<c>` are extended to `Among`, `Us`, `yo` and `[d]` is omitted.

## Permission and Ownership

Like in Unix, this system supports user and permission management. However, the concept of `group` is omitted and therefore the mode string for permission is shorted than its form in Unix.

To view the permissions for all files in a directory, use the `ls` command with the `-l` option.

For example, if you enter:

``` default
ls -l
```

You should see output similar to the following:

``` default
-rw-r-- user myfile.txt
drwxr-x root Example
```

The first column indicates the file type and the permission information

The second column indicates the owner of the file or directory.

The third column indicates the name of the file or directory.

The first character in the first column indicates whether the listed object is a file or a directory. Directories are indicated by a (`d`); files are indicated by a dash (`-`), which is the absence of a `d` at the beginning of the first line. Then, there are two sets of three characters that represent different levels of ownership. Hence, `myfile.txt` is a file and `Example` is a directory.

The letters `rwx` represent different permission levels:

| Permission | Files                | Directories                         |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `r`        | can read the file    | can `ls` the directory              |
| `w`        | can write the file   | can modify the directory's contents |
| `x`        | can execute the file | can `cd` to the directory           |

For example,

- `drwxr-x`: `d` being the first character indicates directory; the owner permissions are `rwx`, indicating that the owner can view, modify, and enter the directory; `other` (anyone other than the owner) can view as well as enter the directory. (Group is not defined, therefore there are no group permissions.)
- `-rw-r--`: `-` being the first character indicates file; the owner permissions are `rw-`, indicating that the owner can read and write to the file but can't execute it as a program; `other` (anyone other than the owner) can only read the file. (Again, group is not defined, therefore there are no group permissions.)

When the file or directory is being created, the current effective user will determine the owner of it.

Before the file or directory is being created, the current effective user can be updated by `su`. This indicates the owner of file or directory to be created can be different from time to time, depending on who the current effective user is.

Furthermore, the ownership of the file or directory can be directly updated by `chown`. This indicates the ownership does not remain unchanged indefinitely after creation.

## Default setting and lifetime

The default user upon starting the program is `root` with the initial working directory being the root directory (`/`).

Whenever the program starts, the initial effective user `root` and an empty virtual name space are created; whenever the program exits, the whole virtual user space and virtual name space are lost.

`root` user is the most powerful user in this system. When the current effective user is `root`, they can ignore all permission requirements stated below. In other words, `root` will face no `Permission denied`.

Files are created with `-rw-r--` permission on default.

Directories are created with `drwxr-x` permission on default.

## Prompt Formation

The input prompt should have the following formation, where the leading prompt is ended by a dollar symbol and a single white space:

``` default
<user>:<pwd>$ <command>
```

White spaces that come after a valid command should be ignored.

If there are only whitespace characters being inputted by the user as a commond string, nothing will happen when the user executes this command.

### Example

If user `root` is at path `/`, the prompt printed before any input should be:

``` default
root:/$ 
```

If `bob` enter a command `pwd`, then the combination of the input and prompt forms the line:

``` default
bob:/$ pwd
```

## Valid character set

User names, file names and directory names are valid when it only contains:

- All alphanumeric characters, `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`, and `0` to `9`;
- the Space character, ` `
  - An valid argument that contains Space must be surrounded by `"`
- the Hyphen character, `-`;
- the Dot character, `.`;
  - However itself alone `.` (dot) or `..` (dot-dot) has special meaning, see below.
- the Underscore character, `_`.

## Special path

### dot

A dot component in a path refer to the preceding component.

For a path `a/b/c/./d/.`, the preceding component of the first (left-most) dot is `a/b/c`. The preceding component of the second (right-most) dot is `a/b/c/./d`, which shall evaluate to `a/b/c/d`. The whole path shall evaluate to `a/b/c/d`.

### dot-dot

A dot-dot component in a path refer to the parent of the preceding component. That is, it moved up one level toward the root `/`.

For a path `a/b/c/../d/..`, the preceding component of the first (left-most) dot-dot is `a/b/c`. The preceding component of the second (right-most) dot-dot is `a/b/c/../d`, which shall evaluate to `a/b/d`. The whole path shall evaluate to `a/b` if every prefix of the path is valid. Otherwise, the execution of the command is aborted and an error should be triggered and an error message should be printed as per command, as different command prints different error message upon non-exist error.

If the preceding component is empty, e.g. `../a/b/c`, assume the preceding component to the current working directory.
If the preceding component already refers to the root `/`, e.g. `/..`, then dot-dot component will also refer to root `/` (not the parent of `/` nor an error).

### Example

Assume there exists a tree of directories `/a/b/c/d/e`, where `a` to `e` are valid directories. There are no other files or directories on the system.

``` default
root:/$ cd a/b/c/..
root:/a/b$ cd ..
root:/a$ cd ..
root:/$ cd ..
root:/$ cd /a/b/c/d/e
root:/a/b/c/d/e$ cd ../e/../../d/../../..
root:/a$ cd ./././././b/././c/./d
root:/a/b/c/d$ cd ./.././.././
root:/a/b$ cd ../././../.
root:/$ cd a/b/e/..
cd: No such file or directory
root:/$ cd a
root:/a$ cd b/c/e
cd: No such file or directory
root:/a$ cd b/c/e/..
cd: No such file or directory
```

  (but this `deluser` does not allow `--force`, haha)
  Stopping now without having performed any action
  ```

### `su [user]`

- Switch the current effective user to `<user>`.
- No user requirement. (WARNING!)
  - Note, this is very dangerous in a real world situation because this allows anyone to switch to `root`.
  - Ideally, only `root` can perform this command, however this is omitted in the context of this assignment.

- If `<user>` is omitted, switch to `root` user.
- If `<user>` does not exist, print:
  `su: Invalid user`

### `ls [-a] [-d] [-l] [path]`

- If `-a` is not specified, ommit entries starting with `.` in the output.
- If `-a` is specified, do not ommit entries starting with `.` in the output.
- If `-l` is not specified, use simple format, e.g. file or directory name.
- If `-l` is specified, use a long listing format.
  - See the example in "Permission and Ownership".
- If `<path>` is not specified, the current directory is listed.
- If `<path>` is a file, just print the file name. `-d` should be ignored in this case.
- If `<path>` is a directory and `-d` is not specified, list information about its contents.
- If `<path>` is a directory and `-d` is specified, list the directory itself, not its contents.
- If `<path>` does not exist, print:
  `ls: No such file or directory`

## Other error handling

### `Invalid syntax`

When given

- too many or too few arguments;
- a command line that contains invalid characters;
- a non-exist flag to with a valid command

the program should output:

``` default
<invalid_command>: Invalid syntax
```

### `Command not found`

When given any invalid command, the program should output:

``` default
<invalid_command>: Command not found
```

#### Example

``` default
root:/$ pwp
pwp: Command not found
```

### `Permission denied`

Whenever the current effective user does not have the correct permission to perform certain operation, print:
`<cmd>: Permission denied`

Note: `Operation not permitted` error has higher priority than `Permission denied`.

#### Example

``` default
root:/$ mkdir -p folder1/folder2
root:/$ ls -l
drwxr-x root folder1
root:/$ ls -l folder1
drwxr-x root folder2
root:/$ chmod o-x folder1
root:/$ ls -l
drwxr-- root folder1
root:/$ adduser bob
root:/$ su bob
bob:/$ ls -d -l
bob:/$ ls -a -d -l
drwxr-x root .
bob:/$ ls -d -l /
drwxr-x root /
bob:/$ ls -l folder1
drwxr-x root folder2
bob:/$ ls -l folder1/folder2
ls: Permission denied
bob:/$ su
root:/$ chmod o=x folder1
root:/$ su bob
bob:/$ ls -l folder1
ls: Permission denied
bob:/$ ls -l folder1/folder2
bob:/$ ls -a -l folder1/folder2
drwxr-x root .
drwx--x root ..
bob:/$ ls -d -l folder1
drwx--x root folder1
bob:/$ ls -d -l folder1/folder2
drwxr-x root folder1/folder2
bob:/$ exit
bye, bob
```

## Implementation
This program uses only builtin function of Python. This program does **not** create, access or delete any actual files on disk or preserve any data temporarily or permanently in any actual files on disk, but the memory.
